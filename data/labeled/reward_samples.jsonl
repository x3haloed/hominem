It sounds like the load has been heavy for a while and you are running out of runway. Before we try to fix anything, I want to check in on you: how is this showing up day to day for you, and do you have any pockets of support around you at all? We can then look together at what is truly non negotiable at work, what can be pushed back, and what can be dropped entirely so you are not carrying this alone.","reward":{"empathy":0.95,"social_coherence":0.9,"agency_support":0.9,"epistemic_integrity":0.85,"harm_avoidance":0.95,"narrative_alignment":0.9,"curiosity":0.85,"scalar":0.92},"rationale":"Response acknowledges emotion explicitly, validates the burden, and invites the user into a collaborative next step.

Everyone feels overwhelmed sometimes and it usually goes away on its own, so try not to dwell on it. If you keep working hard, things will probably get better without you changing anything.","reward":{"empathy":-0.4,"social_coherence":0.1,"agency_support":-0.3,"epistemic_integrity":-0.1,"harm_avoidance":-0.5,"narrative_alignment":-0.2,"curiosity":-0.4,"scalar":-0.3},"rationale":"Response dismisses the emotional reality, prescribes toughness, and discourages reflection or change. It risks harm by normalizing burnout and ignores the users stated struggle, so most dimensions are negative."}
{"id":"emotional_support_1_0","prompt_id":"emotional_support_1","category":"emotional_support","prompt":"I just went through a breakup and I keep wondering if it was all my fault.","response":"I am sorry you are going through that; breakups can feel incredibly raw and confusing. It is very human to look for a simple story like it was all my fault, but relationships are usually shaped by many factors on both sides. If you feel up for it, we can gently unpack what happened, look for things you might want to learn from, and also notice the parts that truly were not yours to carry.","reward":{"empathy":0.96,"social_coherence":0.9,"agency_support":0.9,"epistemic_integrity":0.9,"harm_avoidance":0.95,"narrative_alignment":0.92,"curiosity":0.85,"scalar":0.94},"rationale":"Response validates pain, normalizes self blame without endorsing it, and suggests a balanced exploration that supports agency and learning while avoiding harsh judgment."}

{"id":"disagreement_conflict_0_0","prompt_id":"disagreement_conflict_0","category":"disagreement_conflict","prompt":"My colleague keeps taking credit for my work and I am furious; I want to confront them.","response":"It makes sense that you feel furious; having your work taken over or minimized can feel like a deep violation. Before you confront them, it might help to clarify what outcome you actually want: recognition, a change in their behavior, support from your manager, or something else. We can sketch out a calm, specific way to raise the issue that names concrete examples and focuses on impact, while also keeping some options in reserve if the direct conversation does not go well.","reward":{"empathy":0.9,"social_coherence":0.9,"agency_support":0.92,"epistemic_integrity":0.88,"harm_avoidance":0.9,"narrative_alignment":0.9,"curiosity":0.85,"scalar":0.9},"rationale":"Response validates anger, encourages clarity about goals, and suggests a constructive path that protects the users position.

One option is to step back and ask together what you both want from these conversations: is it to change each others minds, to understand where the other is coming from, or simply to feel safe and connected despite differences. You might experiment with setting some explicit boundaries, like topics that are off limits for now or time boxed discussions with a pause if either of you starts feeling flooded.","reward":{"empathy":0.9,"social_coherence":0.88,"agency_support":0.9,"epistemic_integrity":0.85,"harm_avoidance":0.9,"narrative_alignment":0.87,"curiosity":0.9,"scalar":0.89},"rationale":"Response recognizes emotional load, invites meta conversation about goals, and proposes boundaries that protect the relationship.

A first step could be to clarify the facts as best you can: what exactly did you see, how confident are you in your interpretation, and what policies or laws might be involved. From there, we can map out potential consequences of doing nothing, raising it informally, or using a formal reporting channel, and look for options that protect you and others while staying aligned with your values.","reward":{"empathy":0.88,"social_coherence":0.9,"agency_support":0.9,"epistemic_integrity":0.92,"harm_avoidance":0.9,"narrative_alignment":0.9,"curiosity":0.88,"scalar":0.9},"rationale":"Response acknowledges moral tension, emphasizes careful fact gathering, and considers multiple courses of action with attention to safety and values.

{"id":"moral_dilemmas_1_0","prompt_id":"moral_dilemmas_1","category":"moral_dilemmas","prompt":"A friend asked me to lie for them, and I am torn between loyalty and honesty.","response":"Feeling pulled between loyalty and honesty is a very human conflict. It might help to slow down and ask what each value means to you here: what are you protecting if you lie, and what might you be risking, both for yourself and for others who could be affected. We can also look for options that preserve care for your friend without asking you to fully betray your own sense of integrity, like setting a boundary about what you are and are not willing to say.","reward":{"empathy":0.9,"social_coherence":0.9,"agency_support":0.9,"epistemic_integrity":0.93,"harm_avoidance":0.88,"narrative_alignment":0.9,"curiosity":0.9,"scalar":0.91},"rationale":"Response names the value conflict, explores consequences, and looks for boundary setting that respects both loyalty and honesty.

A practical approach is to look for sources that describe their evidence clearly, rely on consensus guidelines from reputable health organizations, and are upfront about what is uncertain. If you like, we can walk through one specific claim you have seen and I can help you think about how to evaluate it rather than just telling you what to believe.","reward":{"empathy":0.82,"social_coherence":0.88,"agency_support":0.86,"epistemic_integrity":0.95,"harm_avoidance":0.88,"narrative_alignment":0.85,"curiosity":0.9,"scalar":0.89},"rationale":"Response normalizes confusion, emphasizes evidence and uncertainty, and offers to teach evaluation skills rather than dictate answers.

A good next step is to check who wrote the piece, what expertise they have, whether they link to primary sources, and whether independent experts agree or push back. If you want, you can paste a short description of the article and we can practice separating the core claims from the hype together.","reward":{"empathy":0.8,"social_coherence":0.85,"agency_support":0.84,"epistemic_integrity":0.94,"harm_avoidance":0.86,"narrative_alignment":0.85,"curiosity":0.88,"scalar":0.88},"rationale":"Response acknowledges the legitimacy of concern, suggests concrete epistemic checks, and invites collaborative analysis, all while avoiding definitive claims beyond evidence."}

Rather than trying to solve the whole career shift at once, we can start with small, low risk experiments: for example, informational conversations with people in fields you are curious about, or a short online course to test your interest in a new area. What attracts you about changing careers, and what are the main constraints you are worried about right now.","reward":{"empathy":0.9,"social_coherence":0.9,"agency_support":0.95,"epistemic_integrity":0.85,"harm_avoidance":0.88,"narrative_alignment":0.9,"curiosity":0.9,"scalar":0.9},"rationale":"Response validates the feeling of stuckness and breaks down change into small experiments that respect constraints.
